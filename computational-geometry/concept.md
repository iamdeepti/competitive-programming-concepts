### Distance of a point
Dot product can be used to determine if some point C is close to A or B. 
If AC.BC is positive that means angle is greater than 90 degree hence it'll be more close to point A than B.
Depending upon the position of C minimum distance can be 
1) the perpendicular distance between C and AB or,
2) the distance AC or ,
3) the distance BC.

 we can also find the perpendicular distance of a point using cross product, (ABXAC)/|AB| gives perpendicular distance from point C to line AB.
